            Hello, my name is Jason Few and I am a rising sophomore at Duke University. I am pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science and Economics. Last summer, I had 
            the oppurtunity to attended Google Computer Science Summer Institute (CSSI) in Kirkland, Washington where we foundational skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.
            Furthermore, we learned how to utilize Google App Engine and develop our own web applications. 
            At Duke, I am the Treasurer of Duke Black in Business, a member of the National Society of Black Engineers, 
            a music producer for Duke's record label, Small Town Records, and a member of the club basketball team. 
            I am also a volunteer head basketball coach for 12 elementary school students from underserved backgrounds in 
            Durham, North Carolina. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and golf, making beats, exploring the city with friends, and working on independent projects. 
            This summer, I look foward to enhancing and developing my technical skills, learning more about Google's culture and community, and working with a diverse and talented group 
            of people.
