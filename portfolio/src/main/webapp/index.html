          Hello, my name is Jason Few and I am a rising sophomore at Duke University. I am pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science and Economics. 
          Last summer, I had the opportunity to attend Google Computer Science Summer Institute (CSSI) in Kirkland, Washington where I developed foundational 
          skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. Furthermore, we learned how to utilize Google App Engine and develop our own web applications. 
          At Duke, I am the Treasurer of Duke Black in Business, a member of the National Society of Black Engineers, a music producer for Duke's record label, 
          Small Town Records, and a member of the club basketball team. I am also a volunteer head basketball coach for 12 elementary school students from 
          underserved backgrounds in Durham, North Carolina. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and golf, making beats, exploring the city with friends, 
          and working on independent projects. This summer, I look forward to enhancing and developing my technical skills, learning more about Google's culture and community, 
          working with a diverse and talented group of people.
